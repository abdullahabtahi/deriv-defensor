## 🎬 SHOT LIST

| Time | What to Show | What to Say (Key Phrase) |
|------|--------------|--------------------------|
| 0:00 | Blank → Revenue graph | "$32M lost annually" |
| 0:45 | Architecture diagram | "Predicts, explains, acts" |
| 1:15 | **Business Impact page** | "**5x better ROI**" |

## 💡 KEY NUMBERS (Punch These!)

- **$32M** - Annual churn cost
- **5x** - ROI improvement
- **172 vs 127** - Partners saved (AI vs Random)
- **26%** - Cost efficiency gain
- **67%** - Synergy effect discovered
- **99.4%** - Test accuracy
- **89%** - Expected production accuracy
- **$25M** - Incremental value

---

## 🎤 OPENING HOOK (MEMORIZE THIS)

> "Imagine you're Deriv. 10,000 affiliate partners. 20% churn annually.
> By the time you notice, it's too late. That's $32 million lost.
> Can we predict it 30-90 days early?"

---

## 🎯 CLOSING PUNCH (MEMORIZE THIS)

> "5x more partners saved. $25 million incremental value. 26% cheaper.
> Deriv Defensor. Predict. Explain. Defend. Thank you."

---

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- ❌ Don't say "synthetic data" apologetically
- ❌ Don't rush through the GenAI demo (it's the wow factor)
- ❌ Don't skip the 5x ROI number
- ❌ Don't go technical (no "HistGradientBoosting")
- ❌ Don't go over 5 minutes

---

## ✅ PRE-RECORDING CHECKLIST

```
□ Dashboard is running (no errors)
□ Partner P00001 exists and loads

□ Water nearby
□ Deep breath, smile, GO!
```

## 🚨 IF YOU'RE RUNNING OVER TIME

**CUT IN THIS ORDER:**
1. Validation montage (3:45-4:15) → Just say "stress-tested, 89% expected"
2. Pattern discovery deep-dive (2:00-2:45) → Show chart, skip explanation
3. Business impact walkthrough (1:15-2:00) → Just highlight 5x ROI

**NEVER CUT:**
- The opening hook
- The 5x ROI number
- The GenAI live demo
- The closing punch
